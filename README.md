An option is available in the `Resources` tab of the token configuration. `No tooltip`, if true that specific token will not display a tooltip.

## Tooltip manager

This section displays all the available actor types, from here you can decide if they should display a tooltip, by checking the enable checkbox. 

If the custom checkbox is not checked, the actor type will use the **default settings**.

Here you can also **import**/**export** settings for **Tooltip editor**.

## Tooltip editor

This section is divided into two. The settings for the GM, and the settings for the PLAYER, so you could have full control over what players see versus what the gm sees.

### Settings
- `Display name`:
	- GM: If true, will display the name of the token in the tooltip.
	- PLAYER: You can choose which token will display the name based on the disposition. (e.g. if set to NEUTRAL -> FRIENDLY and NEUTRAL tokens will display tooltips)
- `Use accent color everywhere`: If true, instead of the colores set for every icon, the accent color will be used.
- `Accent color`:  The border and title color.

### Tables
You can have a different configuration for every token disposition.

- `Color`: Allows you to change the color for this item's icon.
- `Value`: can be found double right-clicking on a token -> resources tab -> go through the attributes possible for bars, you can use anything from there.
- `Icon`: You can use any icon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery). (e.g. the icon is called heart so fa-heart)
- `Exp`: Marks the item as an expression. The engine behind this is [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/index.html), please read the documentation to see what you can do with it. (e.g. [EXPEXAMPLES.md](./EXPEXAMPLES.md))
- `Nr`: Forces only the number from a string to be shown. (e.g. dnd5e: `attributes.speed.value` -> 30 ft. but you want to show only 30, this option will help with that)
